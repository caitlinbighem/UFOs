## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to build a webpage that contains an inclusive in-depth table that displays the results from filters applied to recorded UFO sighting data. In comparison, the original webpage provided users with a filter for dates only. We have taken the filters one step further for this project by providing the tools and allowing users to filter and search through the data with not just a date filter but also location-based filters.

## Results
After reviewing the original webpage which only contained a date filter that required users to click the ‘Filter’ button for the requested data to display, we introduced new and improved attributes to the updated version. With these new qualities users will have the option to filter by additional data just by adding their specific search criteria into the provided search fields. Once the search criteria is provided the filters will automatically generate a table to display the resulting data. The below images display the webpage with the standard view of data without any filters applied and the resulting table after search criteria is provided and the filters are applied.

## Summary of Analysis
A disadvantage of this webpage is that it cannot currently automatically adapt and adjust to the size of the device it is being viewed on. An image for example, has the ability to resize if the current user decides to zoom in on the webpage, however this can only be done manually at the moment. Therefore, a recommendation for future updates and improvements would be to create additional formatting that allows the webpage to adapt to the view best for each individual device.

In addition to the recommendation above, a survey form would be advisable as well. The survey would focus on the users’ individual experience regarding UFO sightings and be comprised of questions inquiring about description, duration, location and a brief summary. With the new data gathered from this survey, the data set and table can be extended.
